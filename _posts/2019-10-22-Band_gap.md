# Band gap

DFT: self-repulsion problem
Standard DFT (LDA, PBE, and Pw91) includes Self-Coulomb Repulsion artifact implicit in DFT.
The electron interacts with if self. This biases the QM toward extra delocalization of electron states to minimize the self-repusion.
As a result band gaps are usually 1 to 3 eV too small.
Thus CIGS and most III-V are predicted to have zero-bandgap (metals rather than insulators)

Including exact Hartree-Fock exchange into DFT functionals eliminates the Self-Repulsion Problem.

B3PW with VASP ~1000 times the cost of PBE
B3PW with CRYSTAL 3.2 times cost of PBE

B3PW91 with Crystal code is the best among hybrid functionals including B3LYP and HSE.[1]
Mean absolute Deviation (MAD) for band gaps: B3PW91 (0.09 eV), B3LYP (0.19 eV), HSE (0.27 eV)
