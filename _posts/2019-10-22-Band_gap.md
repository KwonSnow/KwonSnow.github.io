# Band gap

DFT: self-repulsion problem
Standard DFT (LDA, PBE, and Pw91) includes Self-Coulomb Repulsion artifact implicit in DFT.
The electron interacts with itself. This biases the QM toward extra delocalization of electron states to minimize the self-repusion.
As a result band gaps are usually 1 to 3 eV too small.
Thus CIGS and most III-V are predicted to have zero-bandgap (metals rather than insulators)

Empirical: add Hubbard U and adjust until get experimental value  
Problem: not useful for design  
Rigorous theory: GW calculate rigorous quasiparticle excitation spectrum using Greenâ€™s function (many-body perturbation theory)  
Problem: full GW: 10^4 cost of PBE G0W0 (non-self-consistent) 10^3 cost of PBE  

Hybrid functional: Including exact Hartree-Fock exchange into DFT functionals eliminates the Self-Repulsion Problem.  
B3PW with VASP ~1000 times the cost of PBE  because of using plane-wave basis set
B3PW with CRYSTAL 3.2 times cost of PBE from using localized Gaussian basis sets[1]  

B3PW91 with Crystal code is the best among hybrid functionals including B3LYP and HSE.[2]  
Mean absolute Deviation (MAD) for band gaps: B3PW91 (0.09 eV), B3LYP (0.19 eV), HSE (0.27 eV)  

Including Spin-orbit coupling (or splitting) is necessary.
