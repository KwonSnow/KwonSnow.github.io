The electronic structure calculation spontaneously separates an electron from the extra hydrogen in the water layer to form a double layer capacitor.

## Constant electrode potential (CEP) model
a self-consistent procedure in which the number of electrons in the unit cell is altered and allowed to be fractional so that the Fermi level, EF, matches the electrode potential. In other words, iterative DFT calculations with varying number of electrons are carried out in electrolyte media.
